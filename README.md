Lab - Word Reverser
===================
Using basic concepts of C Programming from [C Basics](http://talks.obedmr.com) lecture,
create a program that reads input from console with `getchar()` function.

Every word will be automatically reversed and printed when the `Enter` key is pressed.

Your program will continue receiving words to reverse until one of the following keys are pressed, with no other characters:
`EOF`, `Control+D` and `Enter`


General instructions
--------------------
1. Submit your code to your personal fork.
2. Use the  `word-reverser.c` file for your code.
3. Have fun and don't forget the next section.


Test Suite
----------
Build and Test automation is already implemented with the following command. Below some general tips and comments.

- Make sure that your program passes all test cases without errors.
- Remember that this is being executed by a robot script.
- Failed compilation or segmentation faults means 0-graded.
- Failed tests will be properly discounted from total grade.

### Build
```
make
